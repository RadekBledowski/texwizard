# Texture Flow

Fork of <a href=https://github.com/R-033/texwizard>TexWizard by R-033</a>.
Simple script that allows you to easily replace any texture. Initially supported only MW, later was expanded by nlgxzef and now supports following titles:
- NFS Underground
- NFS Underground 2
- NFS Most Wanted
- NFS Carbon
- NFS ProStreet
- NFS Undercover

The main purpose of this script is to be a more stable alternative to TexMod. It works similar to texture packs in Minecraft - each "pack" contains its own textures and a list of bindings to replace existing textures. Multiple packs can be used at once in a single game installation.

Compiled .asi script and an example pack are included in <a href=https://github.com/RadekBledowski/texwizard/releases>releases</a>.

The “Flow” version makes texture pack installation easier by allowing users to simply drag .json and .bin files into the TexturePacks folder inside the scripts directory, while remaining compatible with legacy TexWizard texture packs.

For usage refer to <a href=https://github.com/R-033/texwizard/wiki>wiki</a>.

To make a compatible Flow pack, simply rename meta.json and textures.bin to match the name of your texture pack (NAME.json and NAME.bin).
